Quantitative Risk & Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository serves as a professional portfolio demonstrating the technical proficiency, engineering standards, and strategic methodology developed during my Level 7 AI Apprenticeship (MSc Artificial Intelligence).

Confidentiality & Compliance Notice: This portfolio contains purely original work and synthetic implementations. It does not contain, reference, or replicate any proprietary methodologies, confidential data, or internal processes from current or former employers. All logic presented here is based on publicly available regulatory guidelines (e.g., Basel III/IV, PRA SS1/23) and standard academic machine learning practices.

🎓 Apprenticeship Assessment Components

To achieve a Distinction, the apprentice must meet 100% of the Pass criteria AND 100% of the Distinction criteria across all assessment methods, as defined by the Institute for Apprenticeships & Technical Education (IfATE) Assessment Plan.

This grade validates mastery across the following regulated assessment methods:

Assessment Method 1: Project Report with Presentation

Grade Achieved: Distinction (Meeting all Pass + Distinction criteria)

A comprehensive work-based project documented in a technical report of approximately 5,000 words (+/- 10%), followed by a formal presentation and supplementary questioning.

Report Structure:

Introduction & Background: Outline of the business problem (unlocking capital capacity and strengthening balance sheet strategy).

Methods & Justification: Survey of potential alternatives and justification for chosen ML architectures (Logistic Regression vs. XGBoost vs. Ensemble).

Scope & KPIs: Defining predictive power targets (gAUC/ROC) and regulatory compliance benchmarks.

Data Selection & Pre-processing: Integration of multi-source loan characteristics and borrower behaviour data.

Implementation: Performance metrics and transition from SAS to Python-based automated optimisation.

Results: Quantitative analysis of RWA efficiency and default detection improvements.

Discussion & Conclusions: Summary of findings, implications for balance sheet strategy, and caveats/limitations.

Statistical Rigour: Inclusion of uncertainty, bias, and error estimates as appropriate for PRA-regulated models.

KSB Mapping: Direct mapping of project activities to the Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours of a Senior Data Scientist.

Presentation (75 Minutes):

30-minute presentation covering the high-level summary, practical application of knowledge, and business recommendations.

45-minute technical Q&A assessing the depth of understanding and ability to justify technical choices.

Assessment Method 2: Professional Discussion

Grade Achieved: Distinction (Meeting all Pass + Distinction criteria)

A 90-minute structured discussion underpinned by a portfolio of evidence. This assessment verified mastery over senior-level KSBs including:

Leadership: Mentoring junior analysts and leading technical migrations.

Stakeholder Management: Translating complex outputs for Finance, Audit, and Legal teams.

Continuous Improvement: Evidence of independent study in MLOps and Enterprise Python.

Assessment Method 3: Technical Test (Knowledge Test)

Grade Achieved: Distinction (Meeting all Pass + Distinction criteria)

(Note: If your specific apprenticeship standard included a separate technical test, include it here. If not, you can remove this section based on your specific intake year, as standards evolve. The two methods above are the primary project-based ones.)

📊 Technical Implementation: Risk Benchmarking Framework

This repository provides a clean-room implementation of the technical workflow used during the apprenticeship project.

⚙️ Phase 1: Data Preparation

Data Integration: Combining disparate sources to create a unified view of risk.

EDA & Cleansing: Automated outlier detection and missing value imputation.

Partitioning: Stratified training/testing splits to handle imbalanced default classes.

🛠 Phase 2: Model Development

Variable Selection: Utilizing Information Value (IV) and Correlation matrices for parsimonious feature sets.

Benchmarking: Implementation of Logistic Regression (Baseline), XGBoost (Predictive Power), and Ensemble Methods (Stability).

🧪 Phase 3: Validation & Soundness

Qualitative: Assessing "Conceptual Soundness" and statistical assumptions.

Quantitative: Measuring Predictive Power (Gini/ROC), Explanatory Adequacy, and Population Stability (PSI).

📈 Professional Impact

Operational Efficiency: Replaced manual SAS workflows with automated Python pipelines, achieving a 70% reduction in calibration time.

Commercial Value: Demonstrated methodologies capable of freeing up £20m in capital savings to strengthen balance sheet strategy.
